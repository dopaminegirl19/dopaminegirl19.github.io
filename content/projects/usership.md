Title: A shared ownership app in Golang

Description: A simple terminal user interface in Go

Many of the things we consume we need but seldom use. Usership describes a mode of possession centered around sharing fewer objects within a group, rather than individual ownership of these items. The benefits of usership are cost efficiency and reduced consumption.


I started writing a terminal user interface app in Golang which allows groups of people to keep an inventory of their shared possessions and who currently has what. The idea is that you can then text/call/email the person who has the item you need and arrange to pick it up, then update that in the inventory. 

It's a work in progress, but the SQL querying and beginnings of the user interface are at {{<newtab url="https://github.com/dopaminegirl19/usership" text="this repo">}}.
